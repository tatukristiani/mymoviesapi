Swagger documentation of this API can be found here -> [Swagger Documentation](https://moviesoftwareapi.herokuapp.com/api/api-docs/)  


# Notable utilities used
1. Jsonwebtoken - It was used for password resetting mostly, token would be stored in the database and when needed, it would be used and deleted after.  
2. Nodemailer - This was used to send an email to the user in case of a forgotten password.
3. Swagger - Swagger was used to create a documentation of this API, mostly because this was needed for a school project so I did it in a "prettier" way and to learn more about Swagger.  
4. Heroku - This API is hosted on Herokus website the origin page is found here -> [Heroku](https://moviesoftwareapi.herokuapp.com/) 
5. Node.js
6. TMDB API - My API fetches data from The Movie Databases API.
